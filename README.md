Team Organization and Work Procedures
Our team is primarily utilizing Canvas email for communication, in addition to class in-person meetings. We plan to utilize GitHub’s issue tracker for future projects to help in dividing up the work. Each team member will work in their own branch and we will decide as a team which gets pushed to the master branch.
